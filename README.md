In Android, Content Providers are a very important component that serves the purpose of a relational database to store the data of applications. The role of the content provider in the android system is like a central repository in which data of the applications are stored, and it facilitates other applications to securely access and modifies that data based on the user requirements. Android system allows the content provider to store the application data in several ways. Users can manage to store the application data like images, audio, videos, and personal contact information by storing them in SQLite Database, in files, or even on a network. In order to share the data, content providers have certain permissions that are used to grant or restrict the rights to other applications to interfere with the data.
